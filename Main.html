			<h1> Shajia Abidi </h1>
		
				<p> 
				I'm a senior at San Francisco State University majoring in Journalism and minoring in Middle East and Islamic Studies. <br /> <br />

				I believe in supporting stories with data and love to play with numbers &#8208; thus breaking the stereotype that journalists can&rsquo;t handle math. I can code and use that ability to develop data&#8208;centric stories. <br /> <br />

				I'm a native of Pakistan and is fluent in Urdu and English. Having lived in three different countries with diverse cultures, faiths, and governments, I'm interested in learning and writing about gender, religious, and political issues. <br /> <br />

				I'm currently working as an intern for East Bay Express and El Tecolote, a freelancer for The Tempest, and has volunteered at Genlud, a school-run Danish radio in the past.
